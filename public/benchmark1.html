            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

            <p>
                This document describes a game called "Fizz Run", which is
                designed to be a simple, 2D side-scroller, puzzle game. The game
                will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision
                detection, physics, AI, and side scrolling
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

            <p>
                Fizz Run will be developed for the Windows Platform using the
                Wolfie2D game engine, which is a bare-bones engine developed by
                Richard McKenna for rapidly prototyping 2D games. WebGL will be
                used as the underlying rendering technology. BeepBox and
                Chiptone will be used for all music and sound effects
                management. Artwork and assets will be made with Piskel.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>BACK STORY</h3>

            <p>
                Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite are having a fun time exploring
                Sodaopolis when Baron Vender, the leader of the Vending Machines
                invades the city and kidnaps Fanta and Sprite to keep as
                hostages.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

            <p>
                Coca-Cola’s task is to save his friends and defeat Baron Vender
                by going through 6 different platforming puzzles staged in the
                urban sprawl of Sodaopolis. He has to use his abilities to break
                and move blocks around to get to the end of the stage while
                avoiding obstacles set by Baron Vender.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the first 4 levels you will save all of your friends, and as
                you save them it will allow you to switch them in said levels to
                help you solve the puzzles in new and interesting ways.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>

            <p>
                The game will work like a side scroller, with Coca-Cola and
                friends being able to run left and right, and jump up or down
                onto platforms and other surfaces such that we may scroll up and
                down.
            </p>

            <p>
                Coca-Cola and friends will all act similarly except for their
                unique skill that can be used by the player to complete each
                puzzle. The unique skills are the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Coca-Cola: Throws a cola bomb that blinds enemies.</li>
                <li>
                    Fanta: Can summon a healing bubble that also protects the
                    sprite from projectiles
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprite: Shoots out lemon particles and deals slow acidic
                    damage to enemies. Can also corrode cracked walls.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To change characters the player has to press the “F” key and
                they will be allowed to switch with no restriction.
            </p>

            <p>There also exists powerups across each level such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mentos: Increases the fizz meter of the sprite. If full, a
                    countdown will start before unleashing a giant explosion.
                    This explosion breaks walls and one shots all enemies on
                    screen
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sugar: Increase the movement speed of the sprite for a
                    certain amount of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ice: Can make the drink icy and freeze water when it walks
                    over it. Also increases damage for a certain amount of time.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There exists multiple different types of obstacles and enemies
                that prevent the player from reaching the destination that the
                sprite must interact with or maneuver around:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Water pools: Insta kills the player unless they have the Ice
                    powerup
                </li>
                <li>Cracked walls</li>
                <li>Security guards</li>
                <li>Lasers</li>
                <li>Boxes</li>
                <li>Pressure Plates</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The abilities of the characters affect these obstacles and
                enemies
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3>CONTROLS</h3>

            <p>
                This game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Once
                started, use the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> - Move Left</li>
                <li><strong>D</strong> - Move Right</li>
                <li><strong>LEFT-ARROW</strong> - Move Left (same as A)</li>
                <li><strong>RIGHT-ARROW</strong> - Move Right (same as D)</li>

                <li>
                    <strong>F</strong> Character selection. It will cycle
                    between the characters as you press it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ESC</strong> - This pauses the game and presents a
                    pop-up window to the player displaying buttons to resume or
                    quitting back to the title screen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>

            <p>The GUI Elements</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Splash Screen</strong> - The splash screen GUI
                    simply presents a game logo and a Start button for the user
                    to press when they are ready to play. Upon pressing it, a
                    brief scripted sequence is played explaining the backstory
                    for the game. While playing the message "Press ESC to Skip''
                    should be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If pressed,
                    the game should immediately start.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <strong>Main Menu</strong> - This menu will have a select
                    level button, a controls button, and a help button.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Level Selection Screen</strong> - This screen will
                    list all the levels playable in the game. However, the
                    player can only play a level when they completed the prior
                    one first. When the player first plays the game, only level
                    1 is unlocked and the 5 other levels are locked.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <strong>In-Game Menu</strong> - When a player is playing a
                    level, the ESC key can be pressed to pause the game. The
                    pause menu will have the following buttons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Restart game</strong> - If pressed, the

                            game will display an info screen that includes a
                            description of all game controls (keyboard and
                            mouse).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Help</strong> - If pressed, the game will
                            display information about the game (like obstacle
                            information) and the creators.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Main Menu</strong> - If pressed, the level
                            will be abandoned and the game will return to the
                            main menu.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                    <strong>In-Game GUI</strong> - Once a level starts,
                    Coca-cola will be seen at the level spawn. As the sprite
                    moves around, the viewport will follow it. This may reveal
                    several obstacles and enemies that exist on the level map.
                    While playing the following will be displayed at all times:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Health Remaining Bar</li>
                        <li>Fizz Meter Bar</li>
                    </ul>
                    In addition, a small HUD will be shown to show which soda
                    flavor is currently selected as the sprite. Next to it, the
                    abilities will be shown with their logo and cooldown if
                    there is one at the moment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>ARTWORK</h3>

            <p>
                All artwork in the game will be original. The following needs to
                be created:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite</strong> - Each soda
                    will require animations for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Walking Right</li>
                        <li>Walking Left</li>
                        <li>Jumping Up</li>
                        <li>Taking Damage</li>
                        <li>Dying</li>
                        <li>Using Main Ability</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <strong>Obstacles</strong> - Simple sprites:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Laser</li>
                        <li>Box</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enemies</strong> - They can move or are stationary,
                    each require animations for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attacking</li>
                        <li>Moving</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                    <strong>Ceiling, Floor, & Wall Tiles</strong> - The 6 levels
                    will delve into different parts of the city, ranging from a
                    park, to sewers, to busy streets. We'll use simple tiles for
                    all walkable/collidable surfaces. These tiles will have to
                    clearly define where the walkable surface is. Breakable
                    walls will use a different texture (most likely an overlay
                    over an already existing texture).
                </li>
                <br />
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>

            <p>
                All sound effects will be original. Sounds must be made to
                coincide with each of the following events:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walking</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Jumping</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Dying</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Picking Up Powerups</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Using Abilities</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enemies taking damage</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enemies dying</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Laser beam ambient sound</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Box moving</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>MUSIC</h3>

            <p>
                Each of the 6 levels will have their own accompanying music
                track to differentiate them from each other. Level complete
                music will be played when the player finishes a level.
            </p>
            <br />
